# Transfer-Learning-Using-VGG16-Inception-block-and-Residual-block-for-Image-Classification
Used pre-trained VGG16 model in order to improve the performance of a binary image classification model. Used pre-trained Inception and Residual block in order to improve the performance of a multi-class image classification model. Used cats and dogs image dataset for binary classification task.  Used CIFAR-10 dataset for multi-class classification task.
